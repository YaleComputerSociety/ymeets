**ymeets style guide**
ymeets should be written in TypeScript. JavaScript is discouraged.

Functions that are used across more than one file should be stored in the `\utils` folder rather than be redeclared.

Component files should be declared in PascalCase, with a matching PascalCase function definition. Please do not use class components. Folders that do not contain a component module should be declared in CamelCase.
